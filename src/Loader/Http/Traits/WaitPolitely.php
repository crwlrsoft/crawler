     * As the time websites (or other sources) take to respond can differ significantly, the time to wait until the
     * next request, is based on the time the server needed for the previous response to be delivered.
     *
     * To also have some randomness we (can) define a from and to value here.
     * So for example for a previous response time of 100ms, the default of from => 1.0 and to => 2.0 means that it
     * will wait between 100 and 200 ms from the time of the previous response until it sends the next request.
